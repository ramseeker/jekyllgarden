He was afraid this would happen. He had ordered a [49 inch Samsung Monitor](https://amzn.to/420O5q1)
 for his birthday. He was so careful to bring it inside and unpack it, and **then he saw it**. the crack

 At first he thought he must have forgotten to take off the protective plastic from the front and it was just a
 bubble he saw, but then he realized it was **broken**. Crap.

 Now he had to unplug it, take it off his desk, take it apart and then put all the little pieces back in the bo x
 in the appropriate place and then pack it up and carry the 45 lb box to the [UPS Store](http://ups.com)
 so they can return it to Amazon
 

 "At least I bought it from Amazon" he thought. They will refund him without hassle once they get it and he
 can get another monitor and try again.

 That's all he can do.
