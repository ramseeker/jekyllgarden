This was not the post I had in mind to write today but I just wanted to note how freaking hot it was in Buffalo today.

Read that again: It was **HOT** in Buffalo. In April. Those 3 words don't usually go together like this but after the blizzard of '22
we needed today. And it looks like it was for only today because in 3 days time the forecast is for snow again which is just mother nature fucking with us at this point.

It's like the weather is bi-polar: "I'm Hot!" "No, wait. nevermind".

The kids were out on bikes, and old classic cars were getting their first wash of the season and other signs of summer happened today. It was a pleasant change to get a **taste** of what I hope to be the summer to come.
