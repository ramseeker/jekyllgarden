I quit twitter today. For a few reasons:

1. I rarely used it. I used it a bit when I first found out about it during 2007
 and 2008 but not enough to actually make a dent. I had a few "friends" but
 nobody misses me.

 2. Elon.

 3. see number 2

Seems things are a litte screwy over at Twitter and seeing as how I wasn't using it much anyway
this seems like a good time to pack it in  and  I am for sure not paying[**8 bucks for a checkmark**](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue)

I also find all this social media a timesink that as a busy dad with all the repsonsibilities of
everyday life I find it absolutley mind boggling that anybody has any time to tweet let alone tie
their shoes. But maybe I am just really bad at time management.

I don't have my tinfoil hat at the ready just yet but I am becoming more and more uncomfortable of signing up to a "platform"
only for the platform to change (ie: blue check marks) or worse disappear or made obsolete.  Remember
[myspace](http://myspace.com)? Things change.


I have signed up to use a [Mastadon](https://mastodon.social/explore) as I like the idea of this better. I don't fully grasp
the federated bit, but perhaps that  will come. I just signed up a few days ago and haven't had much time to investigate.
I'm not all that social anyway but it looks a lot... nicer? I dunno.

 A few years back I quit [facebook](http://facebook.com) and I don't miss it a bit so I doubt I will miss twitter at all as well.

 For mastadon? It's too soon to tell.
