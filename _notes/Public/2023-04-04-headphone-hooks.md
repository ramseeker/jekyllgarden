Not the most exciting thing in the world to write about, but if you have headphones, and especially if you have a **collection** as I do
you need some place to store them. I suppos you could just toss them in the box they came in but then you would have to dig them out **every time** you wanted
to use them. 

With hangers, they are always on hook and at the ready. I  recommend buying  good ones because the last thing you want is to have your fancy headphones fall. I hae good luck
with the ones that clamp to your desk as opposed to using the ones with the 3M sticky tape. I don't trust that tape.
