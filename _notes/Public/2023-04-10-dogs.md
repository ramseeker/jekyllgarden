So, dogs.

It's official.Our dog is **crazy**. The thing that most drives me crazy has to be the issue it has with the sliding glass door at  the back of the house. **This dog will not come in!**

I have tried everything. I have tried to use some [dog treats](https://amzn.to/41CqNG3) to waving around some [cheese](https://amzn.to/41m7X5U) and nothing. One of the more annoying things about this is that it seems to be random. Some timees she will wander right in as if she has no problems at all.

But mostly, it's a nightmare.

You can call her from the back yard and she's pretty good at  coming and she will bound up the steps to the door threshold and then **stop**. And after that, there's nothing you can do to get her to come in. At times there's been 3 grown adults all waving ahd encouraging the dog to **just come inside already**.

She will do one of two things:

  1. She will stand there and think that this is a game and you're supposed to grab her and play
  2. She will act afraid of us and shiver and shake like we are going to harm her.
  

The only thing I have found to work **sometimes** is to grab her by the collar if I'm lucky as she's usally too fast for me to get her. Or, I can pretend to put on my shoes and then she might come in. I've also tried closing the door on her in hopes that when I open it again, she will come in.  That never works despite how much I can hope.

I'm hoping that over time this will dissipate and as she gets older she will not want to be outside as much as she does now.
