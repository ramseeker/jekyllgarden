Wow, that got out of hand in a hurry. Last I counted, the 4 year old has 9 of these stuffed toys which are apparently the
[cabbage patch kids](https://amzn.to/3yKEia5) for 2023. At least that's what I think.

What I do know is that the dog loves them and will eat them if given the chance. It got one a few weeks ago and there was **fluff everywhere**. I am not sture what they stuff these things with, but there's a lot of it in there.

These things can be cheap, but the bigger ones can run you more than $40.00 so don't let your dog near them. Ask me how I know.
