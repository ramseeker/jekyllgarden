The title pretty much sums it up. I am finding that I have about 20 minutes to wrtie (give or take) in a day if all goes well.

I had hoped to write everyday here but well...life. It's a good thing I didn't pick a name like jimdaily.com or something of the like.

Perhaps now that I have [quit twitter](https://jimwrites.com/2023/04/22/goodbye-twitter/) I will have a bit more time but we shall see.

The big time sinks seems to be job and family, but they're not going anywhere anytime soon so I will just have to deal I guess.

So far most of my posts have been small and I hope to change that over time and start writing about some real topics but for now 20 minutes is about all I have.

At this point, where absolutely **nobody** is reading this drivel it doesn't really matter much at all but when the time comes where I might actually see an audience it would be nice to find the time to write more.
