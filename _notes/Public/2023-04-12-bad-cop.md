When the wee one starts wailing and screaming when she doesn't get what she wants, I do the thing you're not supposed to do: **cave** and give it to her any way. Because: Daddy's Girl.

Tonight, I can proudly state that I did not cave. I stood my ground and **eventually** I won. Not the war, but the day's battle at least.

The meltdown started as it always does: at bedtime. And boy did it start. She was happily playing and I geve her all  the ususal warning signs that things were winding down but that wasn't enough apparantly and**he screaming began** and she wouldn't stop. I managed after a relatively short period of tinme  to get her to snuggle with me as I find that that's about the only thing that works for us to get her to cool her jets.


Once she settled down we thought we had it sorted, and I went downstairs to write a completely differen pos than what  But then against my advice, she got out of bed and found me, becuase usally I am a sucker for a pretty face.


This time she wanted to be read a story. I told her that ship had sailed and no bedtime story for girls that misbehave.  She lost it it. It was a good half hour of pure tantrum. Eventually she realized that after I put her back in the bed for the 100th time that tonight I meant business and **there is no effing story**. It's a simple rule: no rewards for bad behaviour.


She begged and pleaded but I held my ground and there was **no bedtime story** tonight for little girls that have tantrums.

She just needs to go the fuck to bed. It's all better with a good night's sleep. For all of us.
