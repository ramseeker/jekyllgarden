title: socks for four year olds.

I don't know where these things go. I swear we **just bought** her [some](https://amzn.to/3lvHljg) and yet when laundry day comes there are **no socks**. No, let me rephrase that: there are no matching socks. We have a **lot** of single socks so she wears these because, they're still socks for 4 year old girls.
