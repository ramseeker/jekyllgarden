At last count, we had more than a few laptops kicking around the house and I am to blame for this. Particularily, I am fond of [chromebooks](https://amzn.to/3n22nqC) but the wife likes [apple products](https://amzn.to/40GHnn7) so between the two of us there's more than one.

I remember some of the first apple laptops I had I was making **monthly** payments on them and I think the payments were close to $200 each month. I can lease a car for that much now and the chromebook I writing this on cost me less than $200 and it's **more than all the laptop I need**

When I started this post I was going to **suggest** [laptops to buy](https://amzn.to/3V5Lwjb) but they change so often and have so many variations that it really depends on your needs. A quick search in your favorite search engine for [best laptops](https://amzn.to/3V5Lwjb) will probably be your best bet.
