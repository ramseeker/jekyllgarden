Due to the [overwhelming weather](https://jimwrites.com/2023/04/14/hotter-than-hell/) we've been having
lately I decided it would be a good day to take her for a walk on the river, and it was:

It was an absolutely gorgeous day to take her for a stroll and get some of that 4 year old energy
burned off. Besides, it is supposed to snow by this time tomorrow. Today, it's a **record high** 
for the weather and then tomorrow we are supposed to go back to more seasonal climes. 

Anyway, the walk: I would guess it's about a half mile round trip. We walk a 1/4 mile each way to small bridge
where there's useually somebody with a fishing rod but today there was nobody and we almost had the 
entire trail to ourselves. 

Along the walk we saw a dog jump in the river for a swim, we through more small rocks into the water
than I care to count and we happpened on some logs that had been cut as obviously they had fallen
over the winter on the trail and this trail is maintained so somebody had moved the logs to the side
of the trail and **this** was a whole topic of conversation because **she's four** and there's questions
to be answered. 

Also, I'm getting a bit better at this parenting thing and had enough forethought to pack snacks
so while we were tossing rocks we also were tossing [chex mix](https://amzn.to/3UIwaBh) into our mouths as well. 

Then on the way home I gave her an apple to chew on for the ride home. 

It was a good day today.
