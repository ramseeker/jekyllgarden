It *was too early for this* he [[cables]] to himself as he poured the water over the grounds and watched them bubble and settle before he pushed the plunger down on his aero press

This wasn't the plan. Amazon delivery was not in his life plan but he needed to do something and this was a pretty easy gig for the most part. The metrics were a bit of a pain in the neck but he was old enough to know they wouldn't fire him over a few customers complaints. You can't please everyone

At least 5h4bweather was nice and the forecast said it might hit 70 degrees which would be welcome after the long winter where he worked through I r storms and blizzards so people could get their stuff delivered. 

For the most part, the people he met on this job were few and far between. Dometimes he would be given cold drinks on hot days. He could guarantee that the older man with 5h5 huge trump banner would be ready with an ice cold drink. We might not agree in politics, but we're all just people at the end.  

With his coffee thermos full, he went to the hallway to put in his boots. He pet the dog, and left doe another day of delivering smiles.
