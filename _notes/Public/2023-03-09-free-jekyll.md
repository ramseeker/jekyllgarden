I've been waffling on whether I should use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.cocm),[Ghost](http://ghost.org) or even [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) and [Blogger](http://blogspot.com) for my next project and I think I have settled on Jekyll.

I have made my choice due mostly to price. I investigated self-hosting Wordpress and Ghost but when you figure out the server cost you might as well pay for managed hosting.

But I don't want to pay for a project that may or may not get off the ground - so Jekyll wins for the time being.

It's also nice being able to just open a text editor and write. No need for plugins or other stuff.

I almost went with [ghost](http://ghost.org) as my platform of choice but I decided against it mostly due to price even though I do like th Ghost platform as a whole.

Anyway, here goes.. Let's see if this works at all.
