I sold a few computers today. I had these two [HP elitedesk Mini](https://amzn.to/3zZORqy) desktop computers that were sitting unused so I might as well turn them into a bit of cash. I ended up selling them for $30 each so it's not like I am getting rich off of this sale but it's
stuff out of the house and it keeps the wife happy.

Also, I **might** put the funds towards another [cheap mini pc](https://amzn.to/3KEKwh4) if I can find a deal on one. I am thinking about gettin [this one](https://amzn.to/3MDoyxO) as I find that I use my laptop chromebook tethered to my  to my desk 99 percent of the time and this **might** get me to use the chromebook as a laptop more if I don't have a bunch of cables hanging from it

We shall see.
