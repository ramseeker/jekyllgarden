I don't know how this happend, but we have a **lot** of travel mugs in the house. I bring one with me to work, but I don't know where
the others come from.

I do have a few requirements for a travel mug though and it's a simple request: for it to **not spill*. You would think that would be
a very simple requirement, but nope. I want a lid that does not leak and that's it. But threre seems to be different variations  of the lids
and in my opinion, it matters.  I like to keep my shirts clean and don't want to have cofee spilled all down the front of my shirt so
buying the right travel mug is important to me.
