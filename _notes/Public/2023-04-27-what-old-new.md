I have been amazed by news of concerts and new releases from some older
bands that I grew up with in my youth. I thought I had hit the end of the 
road when it comes to recognizing artist's names when I check the 
weekly new releases. 

But now, it seems all the old bands of yore are making albums and touring. I am not the
most up to date on the current album listings or concerts but still I never thought I would see
see some acts like [the cure](https://www.thecure.com/) or [depeche mode](https://www.depechemode.com/)
tour again but it seems like I'm wrong. 

It's as if the pandemic gave these old rockers time to write new material and realize 
that they're mortal and if they wanted to produce more art then  **now is the time** 

I have no desire to  see these bands live though. Not because I don't enjoy their music
but more the fact that I don't enjoy other people and crowds any more. Maybe I'm old
and crankier but I have no desire to spend big bucks on a concert when I can stream the
album and get higher fidelity without the added cost and trouble. 

Now there's something to be said for concerts, but I'm a: not a big concert goer and b: I prefer 
lesser known acts in small venues when and if I do go. 

But, if your playlists are stuck in the 80's like mine are most days you might want 
to search for your favorites bands and see if they're coming to a town near you.
