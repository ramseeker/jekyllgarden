 In an effort to keep my writing area cleaner I have downsized my headphone amplifers to smaller units but I also replaced the [3 foot RCA cables](https://amzn.to/3FuvR6y) with something much shorter as the 3 footers were just too long when you only need a few inches.

I ended up with [much shorter rca patch cords](https://amzn.to/3FuvR6y) that really help with keeping the desktop clean and I don't have such a mess behind my desk.

These ones are actually nice and are simple and reliable cables and nothing else. I hate the marketing that goes with audio cables that are priced in the hundreds and even thousands of dollar when a pair of ten buck cables will do the trick.
These are well made and cheap.
