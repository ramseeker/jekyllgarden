Thankfully, the weather is getting warmer here in the Greater [Buffalo](https://www.buffalony.gov/) area. I have [survived blizzards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_North_American_blizzard) and ice storms this year and I am glad to be over it now.

We're **not quite** at short sleeve weather, but close. It's supposed to hit 70 degrees later this week which will be **fantastic** after the winter we have had.

We played outside after dinner tonight and although it was a little cool and cloudy it was a blast to be outside with the family again.

It was a long winter on the couch.
