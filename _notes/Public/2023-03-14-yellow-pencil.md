"How come there's never a penci when you need it" he thought as he rummaged through the junk drawer in the kitchen. Ther was string, batteries,
toothpicks, and pens galore - but no pencil. 

He couldn't belive that there was no pencil in the house. How could that be? The wife was a teacher. Maybe she had one in her office.
