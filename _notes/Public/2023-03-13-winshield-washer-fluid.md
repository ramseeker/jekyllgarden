He never really thought much about [[2023-03-13-winshield-washer-fluid]]washer fluid, because it's, well...washer fluid. He just bought whatever blue jug he
could find and poured (most of it) in the car and he was good for another few days/weeks/months depending on the weather.

But then he noticed the cheap stuff was, well...cheap. It wasn't working as well as it could. So he switch to the more
expensive stuff: [RAIN X Windshield Washer Fluid](https://amzn.to/3FmEBM6) and the difference was clear. He could see again.

It's pricey, but it works. And that's all that matters.
