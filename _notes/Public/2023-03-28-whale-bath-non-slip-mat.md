We bought this whale shaped non slip bath mat a few years back now and it's held up very well considering the price of about $20.00. It's held up well and has prevented multiple trips to the emergency room I am sure.

It's got a good amount of suction cups ont the bottom too. Just remember to hang it up after you're using it oherwise it's a bitch to clean. It has a little tab that connects the tail to the rest of the body so you get a "hook" of sorts to hang it on a hook.

Again,hang this sucker up after use. It gets yucky pretty fast oherwise.
