I am not sure how, but I have acquired a whole slew of wireless mice. My current daily driver is a
[steelseries rival 3 wireless mouse](https://amzn.to/3ZjhXuU) which is actually really good for the price. I haven't had a **gaming mouse** before, but it's really a nice device.

The other mice I have are usually [off brand wirless mice][cheapmice] that are just **okay** and not great. I really don't have much preference for wireless mice as long as they work and that's the main requirement here.
