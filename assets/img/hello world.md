He had lost his phone. Again. This wasn't the first time

You would think that for something so important to his day to day life that he would pay more attention to it. It was usually lost in the house somewhere - placed up high where he wouldn't see it normally.

He sighed, and once again hit the "find my phone" app on his watch.

The phone rang it's "find me" tone. He wandered around the house. It had to be somewhere. He went downstairs and nope - not there.
